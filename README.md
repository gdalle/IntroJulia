# IntroJulia

*By [Guillaume Dalle](https://gdalle.github.io)*

This website contains a series of notebooks illustrating the use of the Julia programming language. It was originally designed as teaching material for students of Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech, but it is accessible to a much wider audience.

All of these notebooks can be visualized in your browser without any prerequisites. To edit or run a notebook, click on `Edit or run this notebook` and follow the instructions given there. You will need to [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and add the [Pluto package](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl).

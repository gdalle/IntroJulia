> We are power Matlab users. Some of us are Lisp hackers. Some are Pythonistas, others Rubyists, still others Perl hackers. There are those of us who used Mathematica before we could grow facial hair. There are those who still can't grow facial hair. We've generated more R plots than any sane person should. C is our desert island programming language.
>
> We love all of these languages; they are wonderful and powerful. For the work we do — scientific computing, machine learning, data mining, large-scale linear algebra, distributed and parallel computing — each one is perfect for some aspects of the work and terrible for others. Each one is a trade-off.

> Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature” by practitioners of numerical computing:
> 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow.
> 2. **One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment.**
> 3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts.

What independent users say:

> I was doing a lab rotation where I kept trying (unsuccessfully) to convince everybody to ditch MATLAB for Python. At one of these occasions a colleague quipped **"Don't the cool kids use Julia instead of Python anyway?"**. Surprised and slightly embarrassed that I had never heard of this language (and therefore was obviously not a cool kid) I looked online and found the "Why we created Julia" post. (Julius Krumbiegel)

> I believe my first impressions were: **Unlike Python the syntax for maths is actually nice and first class; and unlike MATLAB it is actually a usable programming language.** (Frames Catherine White)

> I tried Numba, Cython and diving into deep Numpy lore, but no solution was satisfactory. With great resentment, I realized that for performance sensitive computing, there can be no such thing as a Python programmer: I could wrap my code in a Python cloak, but I would have to write all the hard stuff in C. A friend who had picked up Julia for theoretical physics taught me that **my frustration was common in scientific computing, and had a name: "The two language problem". Even better, it had a solution: Julia.** (Jakob Nissen)

> I remember working on an R script that needed to loop through 33 million rows of data, doing a complicated lag/join/basket kind of computation that would take 18 hours to run. Literally during one of these 18 hour runs, I saw the Julia announcement post and was immediately desperate for the kind of simple performance it promised. **I read the initial manual over a weekend, rewrote my script the following Monday morning, and it ran in 5 minutes.** (Jacob Quinn)

> What hooked me wasn't the speed (I was using Fortran before, which was more than adequate for that purpose), but **the composability of the whole ecosystem, which lets you easily leverage other people's work.** (Mosè Giordano)

> My first interaction with Julia was in early 2019 when I was looking for alternative deep learning ecosystems as an undergrad and came across Flux. Having been scarred by unreliable pip/conda installs of Python and the mess of CUDA/cuDNN installations, **I was amazed by the ease of setup** and how soon I was able to get a network training. (Sharan Yalburgi)

> By early 2020, I saw the 1.0 release a couple years back and decided to start learning Julia, and I was immediately impressed. By March 2020, I submitted my first pull request to JuliaLang/Julia and soon discovered that **Julia was a language that I could not only use but also help develop.** (Mark Kittisopikul)

> The responses mentioned the part of the code that might be responsible, and I was able to quickly pull them up from the language repository, understand the code, and fix the issue in an afternoon. That's when it hit me - the two language problem wasn't just about being able to write new performant code in the same language; it was also about **being able to explore all (well, almost all) parts of the language and its ecosystem** with the same knowledge it took to understand your own code. And being able to use the same tools and thought processes you use in your everyday code to explore, fix, or enhance them, however deep you are in the stack. It put power in the hands of the user (SundaraRaman R)

> Third, I use Julia because it is free, open source and because of its community. This motivates a constant peer reviewing process and **a democratic approach to software development, publicly accessible for anyone to join on GitHub**. The community guidelines and an active and welcoming user base bring together not only great coders but also kind and ambitious people (Elisabeth Roesch)

> What really electrified me about Julia was that at some point Stefan or Jeff responded directly to one of my Discourse posts without calling me an idiot and explained some Julia esoterica with great calm (which was not my average internet forum experience). **That moment felt like lightning in a bottle: The creators of a programming language just hang out? And answer your questions? Online? For free???** That still seems to be a bit of a revolutionary openness to knowledge sharing. (Miguel Raz Guzmán Macedo)

> I still remember this moment where I started the PR and the community began pushing me forward. I need to quote what Jeff wrote: "One cannot help but admire this PR. **This starts as an exercise in crashing the system in every possible way, but tknopp does not care, knowing that fortune favors the bold :)**" Never in my live will I forget this post. I was part of this great community. I had the opportunity to make a difference. (Tobias Knopp)

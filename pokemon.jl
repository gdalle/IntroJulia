Before going further, we explain and illustrate a key feature of Julia: _multiple dispatch_.
In Julia, a _function_ is just a name, like `+` or `exp`.
Each function may possess several implementations called _methods_.
These methods are where the real magic happens, because adding two integers is very different from adding two floating point numbers or even matrices.
The right method is _dispatched_ "just in time" based on the types of all function arguments (not just the first one).

# B. Extending Pokémon behavior
"""

md"""
Until now, nothing extraordinary has happened.
You might even think it is simpler to just copy the matrix and be done with it.
The reason why we use types and dispatch fits in one word: _composability_.
Imagine there is a package called `Pokemon.jl` that contains all of the stuff above.
If Nintendo suddently introduces a new family of Pokémon, or a new fight mechanism, we will want to extend that package, instead of recoding everything from scratch.
This is made very easy by multiple dispatch, because we are able to do the following:
- Define new types that work well with existing methods
- Define new methods that apply on existing types
As underlined by Stefan Karpinski in this [JuliaCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/kc9HwsxE1OY), there are very few languages where both of these operations are possible.
Julia is one of them.

First, `friends_naive` is more tedious to write and read, beause everything has to be in the same place.
Second, it is not easy to extend _a posteriori_.
And third, this paradigm often leads to less efficient functions.

This doesn't seem to hold here however, probably because the compiler is smart enough to optimize away the difference.

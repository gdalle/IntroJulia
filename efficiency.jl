## Tracking loops

In long-running code, the best way to track loops is not a periodic `println(i)`. There are packages designed for this purpose, such as [ProgressMeter.jl](https://github.com/timholy/ProgressMeter.jl).
However, since the REPL doesn't work well in Pluto notebooks, we can use the `@progress` macro of [ProgressLogging.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLogging/ProgressLogging.jl) instead.

## Benchmarking

To evaluate the efficiency of a function, we need to know how long it takes and how much memory it uses. Julia provides built-in macros for these tasks:
- `@elapsed` returns the computation time (in seconds)
- `@allocated` returns the allocated memory (in bytes)
- `@time` prints both (in the REPL!) and returns the function result

# ╔═╡ c0a7c1fe-457f-4e52-b0ea-2821e40817ea
md"""
However, the built-in macros have shortcomings: they only run the function once, and their measurements may be biased by the presence of global variables.
We can get a more accurate evaluation thanks to [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl):

- `@belapsed` is similar to `@elapsed`
- `@ballocated` is similar to `@allocated`
- `@btime` is similar to `@time`
- `@benchmark` prints a pretty graphical summary of `@btime`

## Profiling

Profiling is more precise than benchmarking: it tells you how much time you spend _in each nested function call_.
Julia provides a sampling-based [profiler](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/profile/), but it is hard to use without a good visualization.
We recommend using the [`@profview` macro](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/profiler/) from the VSCode extension (or from [ProfileCanvas.jl](https://github.com/pfitzseb/ProfileCanvas.jl) when you're working on a notebook).
However, there are many other options: see the [FlameGraphs.jl](https://github.com/timholy/FlameGraphs.jl) README for a list.

A profiling "flame graph" represents the entire call stack (without C routines), with each layer corresponding to a call depth.
The width of a tile is proportional to its execution time, but you can click on it to make it fill the whole window.
Note that the first few layers are usually boilerplate code, and we need to scroll down to reach user-defined functions, usually below a tile called `eval`.
"""

# ╔═╡ a7de0ec9-6b01-4b42-8cce-bb2295da779f

The colors in the flame graph have special meanings:
- blue $\implies$ everything is fine
- gray $\implies$ compilation overhead from the first function call (just run the profiling step a second time)
- red $\implies$ "runtime dispatch" flag, a sign of bad type inference (except in the first layers where it is normal)
- yellow $\implies$ "garbage collection" (GC) flag, a sign of excessive allocations

The importance of these warnings suggests two basic principles for high-performance Julia:

	1. Facilitate type inference
	2. Reduce memory allocations

## Diagnosing

**Type inference**

The built-in macro [`@code_warntype`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#man-code-warntype) shows the result of type inference on a function call.
Non-concrete types are displayed in red: they are those for which inference failed.

Sometimes `@code_warntype` is not enough, because it only studies the outermost function and doesn't dive deeper into the call stack. This is what the macro `@report_opt` from [JET.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl) is for.

**Allocations**

Julia 1.8 (which is still a pre-release) introduced many novelties.
Among them is a built-in memory profiler, which mimics the behavior of the temporal profiler shown above. We will not demonstrate it here.

# Performance tips

Now that we know how to detect bad performance, we will discover how to achieve good performance! But always remember the golden rule: only optimize what needs optimizing! In other words,

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil. (Donald Knuth)

## General advice

- Avoid [global variables](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-global-variables), or turn them into constants with the keyword `const`
- Put critical code [inside functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Performance-critical-code-should-be-inside-a-function)
- Vectorized operations (using the [dot syntax](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#man-vectorized)) are not faster than loops, except linear algebra routines
- Beware of [closures](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#man-performance-captured) (i.e. functions that return functions)
"""

# ╔═╡ d3c1a86c-8c8f-4ad6-ac3c-2ba0f838d139
md"""
## Facilitate type inference

Julia is fastest when it can infer the type of each variable during just-in-time compilation: then it can decide ahead of runtime (statically) which method to dispatch where.
When this fails, types have to be inferred at runtime (dynamically), and "runtime dispatch" of methods is much slower.

!!! note "The key to successful type inference"
	In each function, the types of the arguments (*not their values*) should suffice to deduce the type of every other variable, especially the output.

Here are a few ways to make this happen.

- Always declare concrete or parametric types (no abstract types) in the following places:
  - [container initializations](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#man-performance-abstract-container)
  - [`struct` field values](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-fields-with-abstract-type)
  - [`struct` field containers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-fields-with-abstract-containers)
- Never write `if typeof(x) == ...`: exploit [multiple dispatch](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Break-functions-into-multiple-definitions) or [function barriers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#kernel-functions) instead
- Define functions that [do not change the type of variables](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Avoid-changing-the-type-of-a-variable) and [always output the same type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Write-%22type-stable%22-functions)
"""

# ╔═╡ fa483fea-bf9f-4764-8d4f-c6d33e3336fb
md"""
## Reduce memory allocations

Allocations and garbage collection are significant performance bottlenecks. Here are some ways to avoid them:

- Prefer in-place functions that reuse available containers (they name usually [ends with `!`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/#bang-convention))
- [Pre-allocate](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Pre-allocating-outputs) output memory
- Use [views instead of slices](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#man-performance-views) when you don't need copies: `view(A, :, 1)` instead of `A[:, 1]`
- [Combine vectorized operations](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#More-dots:-Fuse-vectorized-operations)
- Fix type inference bugs (they often lead to increased memory use)

## Generic programming

Multiple dispatch allows the right method to be chosen based on the type of every argument (not just the first one).
This is what makes it possible for multiple packages to work together without knowing about each other... as long as they remain generic.
In particular, it is not a good idea to overspecify input types: it usually doesn't improve performance, and can prevent unexpected uses of your code.

This is explained in great detail in the blog post [Type-Dispatch Design: Post Object-Oriented Programming for Julia](https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/type-dispatch-design-post-object-oriented-programming-julia/) (Chris Rackauckas).

## Hardware considerations

In order to optimize Julia code to the limit, it quickly becomes useful to know how a modern computer works.
The following blog post is an absolute masterpiece on this topic: [What scientists must know about hardware to write fast code](https://viralinstruction.com/posts/hardware/) (Jakob Nybo Nissen).

## Package latency

A major source of frustration for Julia beginners is the time that elapses from the creation of the REPL until the first useful output, also called "time to first plot".
As a package developer, there are many resources available to help you address this problem:
- Tim Holy's great talk at JuliaCon 2021: [Package latency and what developers can do to reduce it](https://youtu.be/rVBgrWYKLHY)
- Several blog posts:
  - [Analyzing sources of compiler latency in Julia: method invalidations ](https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/invalidations/) (Tim Holy, Jeff Bezanson, and Jameson Nash)
  - [Tutorial on precompilation](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/precompile_tutorial/) (Tim Holy)
  - [Profiling type inference](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/snoopi_deep/) (Tim Holy and Nathan Daly)
